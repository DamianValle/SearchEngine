contemporary
email
addresses
consist
of
a
local
part
separated
from
a
domain
part
a
fully-qualified
domain
name
by
an
at-sign
the
syntax
of
the
domain
part
corresponds
to
that
in
the
previous
section
the
concerns
identified
in
that
section
about
filtering
and
lists
of
names
apply
to
the
domain
names
used
in
an
email
context
as
well
the
domain
name
can
also
be
replaced
by
an
ip
address
in
square
brackets
but
that
form
is
strongly
discouraged
except
for
testing
and
troubleshooting
purposes
the
local
part
may
appear
using
the
quoting
conventions
described
below
the
quoted
forms
are
rarely
used
in
practice
but
are
required
for
some
legitimate
purposes
hence
they
should
not
be
rejected
in
filtering
routines
but
should
instead
be
passed
to
the
email
system
for
evaluation
by
the
destination
host
the
exact
rules
are
quite
complex
but
we
will
only
consider
mail
addresses
whose
left
part
before
the
sign
consists
of
groups
of
word
characters
letters
digits
and
the
underscore
character
separated
by
a
period
for
example
these
are
all
valid
e-mail
addresses
nisse@kth.se
nisse.nisselund@csc.kth.se
u152749889@nisse.gov
jb_15@a.b.c.se
cell..delabadie@sbcglobal.net
what_ever@public.com
in
addition
to
restrictions
on
syntax
there
is
a
length
limit
on
email
addresses
that
limit
is
a
maximum
of
64
characters
octets
in
the
local
part
before
the
and
a
maximum
of
255
characters
octets
in
the
domain
part
after
the
for
a
total
length
of
320
characters
systems
that
handle
email
should
be
prepared
to
process
addresses
which
are
that
long
even
though
they
are
rarely
encountered
the
syntax
for
urls
uniform
resource
locators
is
specified
in
rfc1738
the
syntax
for
the
more
general
uri
uniform
resource
identifier
is
specified
in
rfc2396
the
uri
syntax
is
extremely
general
with
considerable
variations
permitted
according
to
the
type
of
scheme
e.g.
http
ftp
mailto
that
is
being
used
while
it
is
possible
to
use
the
general
syntax
rules
of
rfc
2396
to
perform
syntax
checks
they
are
general
enough
essentially
only
specifying
the
separation
of
the
scheme
name
and
scheme
specific
part
with
a
colon
and
excluding
some
characters
that
must
be
escaped
if
used
to
provide
little
significant
filtering
or
validation
power
the
following
characters
are
reserved
in
many
uris
they
must
be
used
for
either
their
uri-intended
purpose
or
must
be
encoded
some
particular
schemes
may
either
broaden
or
relax
these
restrictions
see
the
following
sections
for
urls
applicable
to
web
pages
and
electronic
mail
or
apply
them
only
to
particular
uri
component
parts
in
addition
control
characters
the
space
character
the
double
quote
character
and
the
following
special
characters
are
generally
forbidden
and
must
either
be
avoided
or
escaped
as
discussed
below
the
colon
after
the
scheme
name
and
the
percent
sign
used
to
escape
characters
are
specifically
reserved
for
those
purposes
although
may
also
be
used
elsewhere
in
some
schemes
when
it
is
necessary
to
encode
these
or
other
characters
the
method
used
is
to
replace
it
with
a
percent-sign
followed
by
two
hexidecimal
digits
representing
its
octet
value
see
section
2.4.1
of
rfc2396
for
an
exact
definition
unless
it
is
used
as
a
delimiter
of
the
uri
scheme
itself
any
character
may
optionally
be
encoded
this
way
systems
that
are
testing
uri
syntax
should
be
prepared
for
these
encodings
to
appear
in
any
component
of
the
uri
except
the
scheme
name
itself
a
generic
uri
syntax
is
specified
and
is
more
restrictive
but
using
it
to
test
uri
strings
requires
that
one
know
whether
or
not
the
particular
scheme
in
use
obeys
that
syntax
consequently
applications
that
intend
to
check
or
validate
uris
should
normally
identify
the
scheme
name
and
then
apply
scheme-specific
tests
the
rules
for
two
of
those
http
rfc1738
and
mailto
rfc2368
urls
are
discussed
below
but
the
author
of
an
application
which
intends
to
make
very
precise
checks
or
to
reject
particular
syntax
rather
than
just
warning
the
user
should
consult
the
relevant
scheme
definition
documents
for
precise
syntax
and
relationships
4.2
the
http
url
absolute
http
urls
consist
of
the
scheme
name
a
host
name
expressed
as
a
domain
name
or
ip
address
and
optional
port
number
and
then
optionally
a
path
a
search
part
and
a
fragment
identifier
these
are
separated
respectively
by
a
colon
and
the
two
slashes
that
precede
the
host
name
a
colon
a
slash
a
question
mark
and
a
hash
mark
so
we
have
http://host:8000/path?search#fragment
http://host/path/
http://host/path#fragment
http://host/path?search
http://host
and
other
variations
on
that
form
there
is
also
a
relative
form
but
it
almost
never
appears
in
text
that
a
user
might
e.g.
enter
into
a
form
see
rfc2616
for
details
these
are
all
examples
of
valid
addresses

of

n10
such
as

in

texas
area
and
410
in

therefore
someone
calling
from

california
to
los

before
the
change
would
have
dialed
213-555-0123
and
after
the
change
1-213-555-0123
which
permitted
the
use
