   Contemporary email addresses consist of a "local part" separated
   from a "domain part" (a fully-qualified domain name) by an at-sign
   ("@").  The syntax of the domain part corresponds to that in the
   previous section.  The concerns identified in that section about
   filtering and lists of names apply to the domain names used in an
   email context as well.  The domain name can also be replaced by an
   IP address in square brackets, but that form is strongly
   discouraged except for testing and troubleshooting purposes.

   The local part may appear using the quoting conventions described
   below.  The quoted forms are rarely used in practice, but are
   required for some legitimate purposes.  Hence, they should not be
   rejected in filtering routines but, should instead be passed to the
   email system for evaluation by the destination host.
 
   The exact rules are quite complex, but we will only consider mail
   addresses whose left part (before the '@' sign) consists of groups
   of word characters (letters, digits and the underscore character),
   separated by a period. For example, these are all valid e-mail
   addresses:

   nisse@kth.se
   nisse.nisselund@csc.kth.se
   u152749889@nisse.gov
   jb_15@a.b.c.se
   cell..delabadie@sbcglobal.net
   what_ever@public.com

   In addition to restrictions on syntax, there is a length limit on
   email addresses.  That limit is a maximum of 64 characters (octets)
   in the "local part" (before the "@") and a maximum of 255 characters
   (octets) in the domain part (after the "@") for a total length of 320
   characters.  Systems that handle email should be prepared to process
   addresses which are that long, even though they are rarely
   encountered.

   The syntax for URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) is specified in
   [RFC1738].  The syntax for the more general "URI" (Uniform Resource
   Identifier) is specified in [RFC2396].  The URI syntax is extremely
   general, with considerable variations permitted according to the
   type of "scheme" (e.g., "http", "ftp", "mailto") that is being
   used.  While it is possible to use the general syntax rules of RFC
   2396 to perform syntax checks, they are general enough
   --essentially only specifying the separation of the scheme name and
   "scheme specific part" with a colon (":") and excluding some
   characters that must be escaped if used-- to provide little
   significant filtering or validation power.

   The following characters are reserved in many URIs -- they must be
   used for either their URI-intended purpose or must be encoded.  Some
   particular schemes may either broaden or relax these restrictions
   (see the following sections for URLs applicable to "web pages" and
   electronic mail), or apply them only to particular URI component
   parts.

      ; / ? : @ & = + $ , ?

   In addition, control characters, the space character, the double-
   quote (") character, and the following special characters

      < > # %

   are generally forbidden and must either be avoided or escaped, as
   discussed below.

   The colon after the scheme name, and the percent sign used to escape
   characters, are specifically reserved for those purposes, although
   ":" may also be used elsewhere in some schemes.

   When it is necessary to encode these, or other, characters, the
   method used is to replace it with a percent-sign ("%") followed by
   two hexidecimal digits representing its octet value.  See section
   2.4.1 of [RFC2396] for an exact definition.  Unless it is used as a
   delimiter of the URI scheme itself, any character may optionally be
   encoded this way; systems that are testing URI syntax should be
   prepared for these encodings to appear in any component of the URI
   except the scheme name itself.

   A "generic URI" syntax is specified and is more restrictive, but
   using it to test URI strings requires that one know whether or not
   the particular scheme in use obeys that syntax.  Consequently,
   applications that intend to check or validate URIs should normally
   identify the scheme name and then apply scheme-specific tests.  The
   rules for two of those -- HTTP [RFC1738] and MAILTO [RFC2368] URLs --
   are discussed below, but the author of an application which intends
   to make very precise checks, or to reject particular syntax rather
   than just warning the user, should consult the relevant scheme-
   definition documents for precise syntax and relationships.

4.2.  The HTTP URL

   Absolute HTTP URLs consist of the scheme name, a host name (expressed
   as a domain name or IP address), and optional port number, and then,
   optionally, a path, a search part, and a fragment identifier.  These
   are separated, respectively, by a colon and the two slashes that
   precede the host name, a colon, a slash, a question mark, and a hash
   mark ("#").  So we have

      http://host:8000/path?search#fragment

      http://host/path/

      http://host/path#fragment

      http://host/path?search

      http://host

   and other variations on that form.  There is also a "relative" form,
   but it almost never appears in text that a user might, e.g., enter
   into a form.  See [RFC2616] for details. 

   These are all examples of valid addresses:

   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the NANPA implemented calling
   procedures that required all long-distance calls within an area
   code to be prefixed with 1 in an effort to make it possible to
   assign central office prefixes with 0 or 1 in the middle
   position. As it had nearly run out of area codes using the existing
   assignment methods, it allowed the assignment of area codes of the
   form N10, such as 210 in the San Antonio, Texas, area and 410 in
   eastern Maryland. Therefore, someone calling from San Jose,
   California to Los Angeles before the change would have dialed
   213-555-0123 and after the change 1-213-555-0123, which permitted
   the use of 213 as an exchange prefix in the San Jose area.

   The country calling code for the NANP is +1. In international
   format, an NANP number should be listed thus: +13015550100 (example
   using the original area code for Maryland). The trunk prefix code
   for direct-dialed long-distance in the NANP is also 1.

   Each three-digit area code may contain up to 7,919,900 unique phone numbers:

   NXX may begin only with the digits [2–9], providing a base of 8
    million numbers: ( 8 x 100 x 10000 ) .  However, the last two
    digits of NXX cannot both be 1, to avoid confusion with the N11
    codes.[citation needed] Despite the widespread usage of NXX 555
    for fictional telephone numbers — see 555 (telephone number) —
    today, the only such numbers specifically reserved for fictional
    use are 555-0100 through 555-0199, with the remaining 555 numbers
    released for actual assignment as information numbers (subtract
    100).  In individual geographic area codes, several other NXX
    prefixes are generally not assigned: the home area code(s),
    adjacent domestic area codes and overlays, area codes reserved for
    future relief nearby, industry testing codes (generally NXX 958
    and 959) and special service codes (such as NXX 950 and 976).

   Various office codes in certain plan areas are deliberately not
   issued, for example, numbers 212718-xxxx, where 212 and 718 are
   both New York City area codes, are typically avoided to prevent
   confusion between an area code and a similarly numbered local
   exchange in the same region. 958-xxxx and 959-xxxx are usually test
   numbers. Inserting 0 or 1 as the first digit of an area code or
   seven-digit local number is invalid, as is a 9 as the middle digit
   of an area code; these are trunk prefixes or reserved for North
   American Numbering Plan expansion. Lists of exchanges in an
   individual area code (posted by CNAC in Canada, NANP in the United
   States) all list various prefixes as deliberately not issued.

   The number of really, really important numbers are 5, or perhaps
   4. Or maybe 3: 16, 17, and 18 are England's most important
   numbers. Hey, you're crazy -- you can't say that! Yes, I can, and
   I'll write 'em one after the other.
